#### What this is: Questions in blue from the assignment sheet.

#### Part 1.


 1. Which software did you use to conduct your analysis?

I used the BioPython code from class.

 2. How similar were the two sequences (`s1.fasta` and `s2.fasta`) which you applied an alignment program?

They are similar, as they received a score of 16.

 3. Are the two sequences closely related to each other, in your opinion?

 Yes, I do believe that they are closely related to each other.

 4. What proof do you have to suggest such a claim?

  The purpose of this algorithm is to find all possible alignments with the highest score (after a score is assigned to every possible alignment). After displaying alignments:

  ```
  ATTT--C-ACAGTATTCACTGAG-
  ||||  | ||| | |||||  ||
  ATTTGGCTACA-T-TTCAC--AGT
  ```
  the score of 16 was outputted, considering each sequences had 20 characters each.





#### Part 2
 1. How much similarity exists between each of the sequences to the others?

#TODO


 2. Based on your results so far (which are too few to provide a comprehensive study), do you believe there is evidence that human adaptation is occurring in H5N1 viruses that might merit concern about human-to-human transmission in the near future?

 3. Statistics: What were the numbers of Lengths, Similarities, Gaps and Scores for each of your alignment tasks?
